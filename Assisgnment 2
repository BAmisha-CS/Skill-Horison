#  Passive Footprinting & Reconnaissance of a Web Application

## Objective

This assignment focuses on **passively gathering publicly available information** about a target web application without directly interacting with its servers. The goal is to understand the initial stages of penetration testing and ethical hacking using Kali Linux tools.

## Scope & Guidelines

- **Only legal targets** are allowed (e.g., approved bug bounty domains, test labs, or your own infrastructure).
- **Do NOT target unauthorized or personal websites.**

## Tasks Breakdown

### Step 1: Domain Information Gathering

- Use `whois`, `dig`, and `nslookup` to collect:
  - Domain registrar details
  - DNS records (A, MX, TXT, etc.)

### Step 2: Subdomain Enumeration

Use passive techniques to discover subdomains with:

- `subfinder`
- `assetfinder`
- `amass` (in passive mode)

### Step 3: Email & Employee Discovery

- Use `theHarvester` to gather emails, names, and host info from:
  - Google
  - Bing
  - LinkedIn
  - Other public sources

### Step 4: Metadata Extraction

- Download public files (PDF, DOCX, PPTX) and analyze their metadata using:
  - `exiftool`
  - `strings`
  - `metagoofil`

### Step 5: Google Dorking

Perform passive searches using advanced Google queries:

```bash
site:example.com filetype:pdf
site:example.com intitle:"index of"
